This project is a simple game stub in the style of Vampire Survivors.
The player is the white circle. Player fires at the nearest enemy
every 2 seconds. New waves of enemies spawn every 10 seconds.
Enemies travel straight towards the player. If the player collides
with an enemy they will lose one health point and become invulnerable to
further damage for half a second. The player has 10 health points.
It's game over if you lose them all.
If you defeat all enemies, you win.
